      <p className='text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-white'>
        During my courses for <span className="text-teal-500">data analytics</span>, I discovered that I was most
        engaged when learning <span className="text-teal-500">R</span> and <span className="text-teal-500">sql</span>.
        As much as I enjoyed working with data in<span className="text-teal-500"> Excel</span> and creating data
        visualizations with <span className="text-teal-500"> Tableau</span>, cleaning and plotting data in
        <span className="text-teal-500"> RStudio</span> or querying large databases in
        <span className="text-teal-500"> BigQuery</span> made me feel like I was hacker in a movie.
      </p>
      <p className='text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-white'>
        I decided then that I needed to pivot and signed up for a entry level <span className="text-teal-500">Python </span>
        program offered by the University of Michigan. I was hooked. I jumped into the never-ending rabbit hole of learning
        <span className="text-teal-500"> web development</span> and did a follow up course focused on building web applications with
        <span className="text-teal-500"> Python</span> and <span className="text-teal-500">Django</span>.
        After seeing the industry start to lean heavily towards component based web development with<span className="text-teal-500"> React</span>,
        I signed up for a front-end developer course focused on <span className="text-teal-500"> Javascript</span> and <span className="text-teal-500"> React </span>
        and have really been blown away with how powerful it is.
